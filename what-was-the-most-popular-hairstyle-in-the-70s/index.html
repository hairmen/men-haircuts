From the shag to the afro, there were plenty of styles to choose from. However, one hairstyle stood out above the rest as the most popular: the feathered look.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The feathered look was a hairstyle that involved a lot of layering and volume. The hair was typically parted in the middle and then feathered back on either side, creating a feather-like appearance. This style was popularized by celebrities like Farrah Fawcett and became a staple for women throughout the decade.</p><h2>How to Achieve the Feathered Look</h2><p>If you want to try out the feathered look for yourself, here's how to do it:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean, Dry Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair and let it air dry or blow dry it until it's completely dry. The feathered look works best on clean, dry hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Part Your Hair in the Middle</h3><p>Use a comb to create a middle part in your hair. Make sure the part is straight and goes all the way to the back of your head.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into two parts, one on either side of your head. Use hair clips to keep each section in place.</p><h3>Step 4: Use a Round Brush</h3><p>Use a round brush to curl the ends of your hair under. Start at the bottom of each section and work your way up to the top. Make sure you're curling the hair away from your face.</p><h3>Step 5: Use a Hair Dryer</h3><p>Use a hair dryer to blow dry each section of hair. Hold the dryer about six inches away from your head and use it to dry your hair as you continue curling it with the round brush.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Once you've finished blow drying and curling your hair, use hairspray to hold the style in place. Spray lightly all over your head, focusing on the ends of your hair.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining the Feathered Look</h2><p>If you want to keep your feathered look looking great, here are some tips to follow:</p><ul><li>Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body to your hair.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can lead to damage and breakage.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair, especially when it's wet.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What other hairstyles were popular in the 70s?</h3><p>Other popular hairstyles in the 70s included the shag, the afro, and the Farrah Fawcett flip.</p><h3>Can men wear the feathered look?</h3><p>While the feathered look was primarily a women's hairstyle, men could also wear a variation of it with longer hair.</p><h3>Is the feathered look still popular today?</h3><p>The feathered look has made a comeback in recent years, with many celebrities sporting the style on the red carpet.</p><h2>Hair Care for the Feathered Look</h2><p>To keep your hair looking healthy and shiny with the feathered look, follow these hair care tips:</p><ul><li>Use a heat protectant spray before blow drying or using hot tools on your hair.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair moisturized.</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as this can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV protectant spray.</li></ul><p>The feathered look may have been the most popular hairstyle in the 70s, but it's still a classic look that can be worn today. With a little bit of effort and the right products, you can achieve this iconic style and make it your own.</p></article>
