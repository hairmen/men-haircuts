Therefore, choose products that contain antioxidants to help maintain your hair's health and vitality.</p><h3>4. Consider your hair type</h3><p>Choose a shampoo and conditioner that is specifically formulated for your hair type. If you have dry hair, look for products that are moisturizing and hydrating.
