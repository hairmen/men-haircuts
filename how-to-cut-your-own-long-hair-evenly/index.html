Use clips to hold each section in place.</p><h2 id="cutting">Cutting Your Hair</h2><p>Now it's time to start cutting your hair. Start with one of the front sections and comb it straight down. Use your scissors to cut the ends of your hair, using the length you want to achieve as a guide.</p><p>Once you've cut one side, repeat the process on the other side to ensure they're even. Then, move on to the back sections and cut them in the same way.</p><h2 id="back">Cutting the Back of Your Hair</h2><p>Cutting the back of your hair can be tricky, as you can't see what you're doing. To make it easier, use your handheld mirror to see the back of your head while you're cutting.</p><p>If you're struggling to cut the back of your hair evenly, you may want to ask a friend or family member to help you.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for a Professional-Looking Cut</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve a professional-looking cut:</p><ul><li>Make sure your scissors are sharp</li><li>Cut small sections at a time</li><li>Use a comb to guide your scissors</li><li>Take breaks to check your progress</li><li>Don't cut your hair too short - you can always cut more later</li></ul><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Can I cut my own hair if it's curly?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your own hair if it's curly.
