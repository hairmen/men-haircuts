You can add some gel or mousse to create a more defined look, or leave it natural for a more relaxed vibe. <h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Mullet Hair</h2> Cutting mullet hair can be tricky, especially if you're new to the style. Here are a few tips to make the process easier: - Start with a longer length and work your way down.

Cutting hair takes time and practice, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't turn out perfect the first time. <h2 id="faq">FAQs About Mullet Haircuts</h2> Q: What is a mullet haircut?
