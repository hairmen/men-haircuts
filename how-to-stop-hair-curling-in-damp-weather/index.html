Just be sure to use a small amount and apply it evenly throughout your hair to avoid a greasy look.</p><h3>Q: How often should I deep condition my hair?</h3><p>A: It's recommended to deep condition your hair once a week to keep it healthy and well-moisturized.</p><p>With these tips and tricks, you can keep your hair looking sleek and smooth even on the dampest of days.
