In this article, we'll take a closer look at what was popular to wear in the 60s.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#paragraph1">Paragraph 1: Mod Fashion</a></li><li><a href="#paragraph2">Paragraph 2: Hippie Fashion</a></li><li><a href="#paragraph3">Paragraph 3: Mini Skirts</a></li><li><a href="#paragraph4">Paragraph 4: Go-Go Boots</a></li><li><a href="#paragraph5">Paragraph 5: Bold Patterns</a></li><li><a href="#paragraph6">Paragraph 6: Shift Dresses</a></li><li><a href="#paragraph7">Paragraph 7: Bell-Bottoms</a></li><li><a href="#paragraph8">Paragraph 8: Mod Hairstyles</a></li><li><a href="#paragraph9">Paragraph 9: Hippie Hairstyles</a></li><li><a href="#paragraph10">Paragraph 10: Tips for Wearing 60s Fashion Today</a></li></ul><h3 id="paragraph1">Paragraph 1: Mod Fashion</h3><p>Mod fashion originated in London in the early 60s and quickly spread around the world. The mod look was characterized by slim-fitting suits, skinny ties, and button-down shirts. Women's mod fashion featured mini skirts, go-go boots, and bold geometric patterns. The mod look was popularized by bands like The Beatles and The Who, and it remains one of the most iconic fashion trends of the 60s.</p><h3 id="paragraph2">Paragraph 2: Hippie Fashion</h3><p>While mod fashion was all about clean lines and sleek silhouettes, hippie fashion was about flowing fabrics, loose fits, and natural materials. Hippie fashion was all about expressing oneself and rejecting mainstream ideas of beauty. The hippie look featured bell-bottoms, tie-dye shirts, and embroidered vests. Women's hippie fashion often included long, flowing skirts and peasant blouses. The hippie look was popularized by musicians like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, and it remains a beloved fashion trend to this day.</p><h3 id="paragraph3">Paragraph 3: Mini Skirts</h3><p>The mini skirt is one of the most iconic fashion trends of the 60s. The mini skirt was a symbol of female liberation and rebellion, and it quickly became a staple of mod fashion. The mini skirt was typically worn with go-go boots or Mary Jane shoes.</p><h3 id="paragraph4">Paragraph 4: Go-Go Boots</h3><p>Go-go boots were a staple of mod fashion. These knee-high boots were typically made of patent leather and featured a block heel. Go-go boots were often worn with mini skirts or shift dresses.</p><h3 id="paragraph5">Paragraph 5: Bold Patterns</h3><p>The 60s was all about bold patterns and bright colors. Mod fashion featured geometric patterns, while hippie fashion favored paisley and floral prints. Bold patterns were often paired with solid-colored pieces to create a statement look.</p><h3 id="paragraph6">Paragraph 6: Shift Dresses</h3><p>The shift dress was a popular silhouette in the 60s. This simple, straight-cut dress was typically worn above the knee and featured clean lines and minimal embellishments. Shift dresses were often worn with go-go boots or Mary Jane shoes.</p><h3 id="paragraph7">Paragraph 7: Bell-Bottoms</h3><p>Bell-bottoms were a staple of hippie fashion. These flared pants were typically made of denim and featured a wide bell-shaped leg. Bell-bottoms were often worn with platform shoes and peasant blouses.</p><h3 id="paragraph8">Paragraph 8: Mod Hairstyles</h3><p>Mod hairstyles were typically short and sleek. Women's hair was often styled in a bob or a pixie cut, while men's hair was typically styled in a clean, side-parted look. The mod look was all about clean lines and minimalism, and this was reflected in the hairstyles of the era.</p><h3 id="paragraph9">Paragraph 9: Hippie Hairstyles</h3><p>Hippie hairstyles were all about long, flowing locks. Women's hair was often worn straight and parted down the middle, while men's hair was typically grown out and styled in a shaggy, unkempt look. The hippie look was all about rejecting societal norms of beauty, and this was reflected in the hairstyles of the era.</p><h3 id="paragraph10">Paragraph 10: Tips for Wearing 60s Fashion Today</h3><p>While 60s fashion is undeniably iconic, it can be tricky to wear today without looking like you're wearing a costume. Here are a few tips for incorporating 60s fashion into your wardrobe:</p><ul><li>Choose one statement piece and build your outfit around it</li><li>Pair vintage pieces with modern pieces for a more contemporary look</li><li>Accessorize with 60s-inspired pieces like round sunglasses or a floppy hat</li><li>Don't be afraid to experiment with bold patterns and bright colors</li></ul><br/><br/><p>In conclusion, 60s fashion was all about expressing oneself and rejecting societal norms. Whether you were a mod or a hippie, there was a fashion trend for you in the 60s. Today, 60s fashion continues to inspire designers and fashion lovers alike, and it remains one of the most beloved fashion eras of all time.</p></article>
