The 60s saw the emergence of new genres such as rock, folk, and soul, and the birth of iconic musicians such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Aretha Franklin. In this article, we'll take a closer look at what was the style of music in the 60s and how it shaped the music industry going forward.</p><h2>The Sound of the 60s</h2><p>The sound of the 60s was characterized by a mix of different genres. Rock and roll had been around for a few years, but it wasn't until the Beatles burst onto the scene in 1963 that the genre really took off. The Beatles' sound was a mix of rock and roll, pop, and folk, and their songs were catchy, upbeat, and often featured complex harmonies.</p><p>Folk music was also popular in the 60s, thanks in part to musicians like Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. Folk music was often seen as protest music, with lyrics that tackled issues such as civil rights and the Vietnam War. The simplicity of the music was also a draw for listeners.</p><p>Soul music emerged in the 60s, with musicians like Aretha Franklin and James Brown leading the way. Soul music was characterized by its use of horns, drums, and bass, and its lyrics often focused on love and heartbreak.</p><h2>The Impact of 60s Music</h2><p>The music of the 60s had a profound impact on the music industry and popular culture as a whole. The emergence of new genres such as rock and roll and soul paved the way for a more diverse range of music, and the popularity of folk music helped to inspire a new generation of singer-songwriters.</p><p>Many of the musicians who emerged in the 60s went on to become some of the most iconic figures in music history. The Beatles, for example, are still regarded as one of the greatest bands of all time, and their influence can be heard in the music of countless artists today.</p><p>The 60s also saw the rise of the album as an art form. Musicians began to experiment with longer, more complex songs and albums that told a story or conveyed a message. This helped to elevate music from something that was simply entertainment to something that could be seen as a work of art.</p><h2>Why 60s Music Still Matters</h2><p>Even though the 60s are now more than 50 years in the past, the music of the era still resonates with people today. Many of the issues that were tackled in 60s music, such as civil rights and the Vietnam War, are still relevant today, and the music's message of love and peace is still something that people strive for.</p><p>Additionally, the music of the 60s helped to lay the foundation for the music industry as we know it today. Without the experimentation and innovation of musicians like The Beatles and Bob Dylan, it's hard to say where music would be today.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>What was the style of music in the 60s? It was a time of experimentation and innovation, a time when new genres emerged and old ones were transformed. The music of the 60s had a profound impact on the music industry and popular culture as a whole, and its influence can still be felt today. Whether you're a fan of rock and roll, folk, or soul, there's no denying the impact that 60s music had on the world.</p></article>
