However, be sure to rinse it thoroughly, as leftover product can cause irritation and dryness.</p><h3>Q: How can I tame frizz in my hair?</h3><p>A: Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner that is designed to moisturize and tame frizz. Avoid using hot water when washing your hair, and use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair.
