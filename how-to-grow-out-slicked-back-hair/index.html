Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Start by letting your hair grow out</h3><p>The first step to growing out slicked back hair is to simply let it grow. This means avoiding any haircuts or trims for a while, which can be tough if you're used to getting regular haircuts. However, it's important to resist the urge to trim your hair too early on, as this can slow down the growing process and make it harder to achieve the style you want.</p><h3>Step 2: Experiment with different hairstyles</h3><p>While you're waiting for your hair to grow out, you can experiment with different hairstyles to keep things fresh. You can try wearing your hair down, parting it differently, or even trying out a new hair accessory. This can help you get used to the idea of having longer hair and make the transition easier.</p><h3>Step 3: Use hair products to manage your hair</h3><p>As your hair grows out, you'll need to use hair products to manage it and keep it looking good. This might include using a quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy, as well as using styling products like a pomade or hair wax to help shape your hair into the style you want.</p><h3>Step 4: Visit your hairstylist for a trim</h3><p>Once your hair has grown out a bit, it's a good idea to visit your hairstylist for a trim. This can help remove any split ends or damaged hair and give your hair a healthy start as you continue to grow it out. Be sure to communicate with your stylist about your goals for growing out your hair, as they can offer advice and guidance on how to achieve the look you want.</p><h3>Step 5: Be patient</h3><p>Growing out slicked back hair takes time, so it's important to be patient and stay committed to the process. You may experience some awkward phases where your hair looks a bit messy or unkempt, but don't let this discourage you.
