You can always cut more if needed, but you can't put it back once it's cut. </li><li>Use sharp scissors to avoid split ends and damage to your hair. </li><li>Don't cut your hair when it's wet because it may look shorter when it dries. </li><li>Use a mirror to check your hair from different angles. </li><li>If you're not confident about cutting your own hair, ask a friend or family member to help you. </li></ul><h3 id="faq">FAQs</h3><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting your own hair in layers black:</p><ul><li><strong>How often should I cut my hair?</strong> It depends on your hair type and the style you want to achieve.
