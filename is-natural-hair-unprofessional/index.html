This can include afros, braids, twists, and other styles that showcase the natural texture of the hair.</p><p>The idea that natural hair is unprofessional stems from a long history of discrimination against Black people and their hair. For many years, Black people were told that their natural hair was "unkept" or "unkempt," and that they needed to straighten it in order to look presentable in the workplace. This belief has persisted for decades, and has resulted in many Black people feeling pressure to conform to Eurocentric beauty standards.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Wear Natural Hair Professionally</h2><p>The truth is, natural hair can be just as professional as any other hairstyle.
