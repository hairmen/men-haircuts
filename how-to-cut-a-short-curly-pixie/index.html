This trendy, low-maintenance style can be flattering on many face shapes and hair types. However, cutting short curly hair can be tricky, so it's important to approach it with care. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to cut a short curly pixie step by step, as well as provide tips and hair care advice to help you achieve the best results. <h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Cut a Short Curly Pixie</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Cutting Short Curly Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Short Curly Pixie Haircuts</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Cut a Short Curly Pixie</h2> Cutting a short curly pixie can be intimidating, but with the right technique and tools, it's achievable for anyone. Here are the basic steps to follow: <h3>1. Gather Your Tools</h3> Before you start cutting, make sure you have all the necessary tools. You'll need a sharp pair of hairdressing scissors, a comb, and hair clips to section your hair. <h3>2. Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3> It's best to cut your hair when it's clean and dry. This will give you a more accurate idea of how much length you're taking off and how the curls will fall. <h3>3. Section Your Hair</h3> Divide your hair into four sections: top, back, and two sides. Use hair clips to keep each section separate. <h3>4. Cut the Back</h3> Starting with the back section, comb your hair straight down and cut it to your desired length. Remember to cut less than you think you need, as curly hair tends to shrink when it dries. <h3>5. Cut the Sides</h3> Next, move on to the side sections. Comb your hair straight down and cut it to match the length of the back. Make sure you're cutting both sides evenly. <h3>6. Cut the Top</h3> Finally, work on the top section. Comb your hair forward, and again, cut it to match the length of the back and sides. You can also add layers to the top section for more volume and texture. <h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2> If you're still unsure about how to cut a short curly pixie, here's a more detailed guide to follow: <h3>1. Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3> As mentioned before, it's important to start with clean, dry hair. This will help you see how your curls naturally fall and prevent any surprises when your hair dries. <h3>2. Section Your Hair</h3> Use a comb to part your hair into four sections: top, back, and two sides. Use hair clips to keep each section separate. <h3>3. Cut the Back</h3> Starting with the back section, comb your hair straight down and cut it to your desired length. Use the point-cutting technique to create a softer, more natural look. This involves holding the scissors vertically and cutting into the hair at an angle. <h3>4. Cut the Sides</h3> Move on to the side sections, combing your hair straight down and cutting it to match the length of the back. Use the same point-cutting technique as before to blend the layers. <h3>5. Cut the Top</h3> Finally, work on the top section. Comb your hair forward, and again, cut it to match the length of the back and sides. You can add layers to the top section for more texture and volume, but be careful not to cut too much. <h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Short Curly Hair</h2> Cutting short curly hair can be challenging, but these tips can help you achieve the best results: <ul><li>Start with small cuts and work your way up.
