While they may sound similar, they actually refer to two different types of haircuts. In this article, we'll explain the difference between a fade and taper, and provide some tips on how to maintain each style. </p><h2> Table of Contents </h2><ul><li> What is a Fade? </li><li> What is a Taper? </li><li> How to Get a Fade </li><li> How to Get a Taper </li><li> Tips for Maintaining a Fade </li><li> Tips for Maintaining a Taper </li><li> Frequently Asked Questions </li><li> Conclusion </li></ul><h3> What is a Fade? </h3><p> A fade is a short haircut that gradually gets shorter towards the bottom of the head. The hair is typically cut extremely short near the neckline and gradually gets longer as it moves up towards the top of the head. This creates a "fading" effect that gives the haircut its name. Fades can be done with clippers or scissors, and there are many different types of fades to choose from. </p><h3> What is a Taper? </h3><p> A taper is also a short haircut, but it doesn't have the same gradual fading effect that a fade does. Instead, a taper is characterized by hair that is cut shorter on the sides and back of the head, while leaving the hair on top longer. The hair is blended from the shorter sides to the longer top, creating a seamless transition between the two lengths. </p><h3> How to Get a Fade </h3><p> To get a fade, you'll need to go to a barber or hair stylist who is experienced in this type of cut. You'll want to communicate with them about the type of fade you want, as there are many different styles to choose from. Typically, the barber will use clippers to gradually shorten your hair towards the neckline, creating the fading effect. The length of the fade can be customized to your liking, and you can choose to have a high or low fade depending on your personal preference. </p><h3> How to Get a Taper </h3><p> Getting a taper is similar to getting a fade, but the technique used by the barber will be slightly different. Instead of gradually shortening the hair towards the neckline, the barber will focus on blending the shorter sides of the hair with the longer top. This creates a seamless transition between the two lengths, resulting in a clean and polished look. </p><h3> Tips for Maintaining a Fade </h3><p> To maintain a fade, you'll need to visit your barber regularly to keep the length consistent. You can also use clippers at home to touch up the neckline and keep your hair looking neat between appointments. It's important to use a good quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and prevent dryness or breakage. </p><h3> Tips for Maintaining a Taper </h3><p> Maintaining a taper is similar to maintaining a fade, but you'll need to pay more attention to the length of the hair on top. You'll want to trim it regularly to prevent it from getting too long and losing the tapered effect. You can also use styling products like pomade or wax to keep your hair looking neat and polished. </p><h3> Frequently Asked Questions </h3><p> Q: Can you get a fade with long hair? </p><p> A: Yes, you can get a fade with long hair. The length of the fade will depend on how short you want the hair near the neckline to be. </p><p> Q: Is a taper the same as a crew cut? </p><p> A: No, a taper is not the same as a crew cut. A crew cut is a short, all-over haircut that is typically the same length all around the head. </p><h3> Conclusion </h3><p> In summary, a fade and taper are two different types of short haircuts. A fade gradually gets shorter towards the neckline, while a taper is characterized by shorter hair on the sides and back of the head, blended seamlessly with longer hair on top. Both styles require regular maintenance to keep them looking neat and polished, but with the right products and techniques, you can achieve the perfect look for you. </p></article>
