It can also make your curls look more defined and bouncy.</p><h2>How to thin out curly hair</h2><p>There are a few different ways to thin out curly hair. One of the most common ways is to use thinning shears. Thinning shears are special scissors that have teeth on one side and a blade on the other. When you use these scissors, they cut some of the hair and leave some of it in place. This can help to remove some of the bulk from your hair without making it look too thin.</p><p>Another way to thin out curly hair is to use a razor. A razor can be used to cut some of the hair and leave some of it in place. This can help to remove some of the bulk from your hair and give it a more defined look.

Razors can be very sharp, and if you’re not careful, you can end up cutting your hair too much.</p><h2>Step by step guide</h2><p>Here’s a step by step guide to thinning out your curly hair:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair and let it dry naturally.</li><li>Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair.</li><li>Section your hair into small sections and clip them up.</li><li>Take one section of hair and comb it straight.</li><li>Use thinning shears or a razor to cut some of the hair and leave some of it in place.</li><li>Repeat this process for each section of hair.</li><li>Once you’ve finished, shake your head to let your curls fall into place.</li></ol><h2>Tips for thinning out curly hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you thin out your curly hair:</p><ul><li>Start by cutting a small amount of hair.
