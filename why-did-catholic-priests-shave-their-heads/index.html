In the Middle Ages, monks and priests shaved their heads as a sign of their religious devotion and dedication to God. This practice was also common among other religious orders, such as Buddhists and Hindus, who believed that shaving their heads was a way to renounce worldly attachments and focus on their spiritual lives.</p><p>Over time, the practice of shaving one's head became associated with humility, poverty, and simplicity. In the Catholic Church, it was seen as a way for priests to emulate Christ's humility and to identify with the poor and marginalized.</p><h2 id="religious-significance">Religious Significance of Shaved Heads</h2><p>For Catholic priests, shaving their heads is a symbolic act that represents their commitment to the Church and to God.
