It’s a semi-permanent makeup procedure that involves using a handheld tool to create small, hair-like strokes on the surface of the skin. The result is natural-looking, fuller eyebrows that can last up to two years with proper care. In this article, we’ll answer the question “Do you keep your eyebrows with microblading?” and provide tips on how to maintain your microbladed eyebrows.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Microblading is a type of cosmetic tattooing that involves using a special tool to deposit pigment into the skin. The tool has a series of fine needles that create hair-like strokes on the surface of the skin. The pigment is then absorbed by the skin, creating the appearance of fuller, thicker eyebrows. The procedure typically takes around two hours to complete and can last up to two years with proper care.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you’re considering microblading your eyebrows, it’s important to find a qualified and experienced technician. Look for someone who is licensed and has a good reputation in your area. Before the procedure, your technician will discuss your desired eyebrow shape and color with you. They will then numb the area with a topical anesthetic to minimize discomfort.</p><p>During the procedure, your technician will use the microblading tool to create hair-like strokes on the surface of your skin. They will carefully choose the color of pigment that best matches your natural eyebrow hair. After the procedure, you may experience some redness and mild swelling. You’ll need to avoid getting your eyebrows wet for a few days and apply a healing ointment to the area.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here are the steps involved in getting microbladed eyebrows:</p><ol><li>Research and find a qualified technician</li><li>Discuss your desired eyebrow shape and color with your technician</li><li>Numb the area with a topical anesthetic</li><li>Use the microblading tool to create hair-like strokes on the skin</li><li>Choose the color of pigment that best matches your natural eyebrow hair</li><li>Avoid getting your eyebrows wet for a few days after the procedure</li><li>Apply a healing ointment to the area</li></ol><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining your microbladed eyebrows:</p><ul><li>Avoid getting your eyebrows wet for a few days after the procedure</li><li>Avoid touching your eyebrows or picking at scabs</li><li>Avoid using makeup or skincare products on your eyebrows for at least a week after the procedure</li><li>Avoid sun exposure and tanning beds</li><li>Apply sunscreen to your eyebrows when you’re outside</li><li>Avoid swimming or sweating excessively</li><li>Touch up your eyebrows every 12-18 months to maintain their appearance</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about microblading:</p><h3>How long does microblading last?</h3><p>Microblading can last up to two years with proper care.
