Going to a salon can be expensive, and not everyone has the time to book an appointment. That's where Brad Mondo, a popular hairstylist on YouTube, comes in. In this article, we'll show you how to cut curly hair yourself, using Brad Mondo's tried-and-true methods.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#howto">How to Cut Curly Hair Yourself Brad Mondo</a></li><li><a href="#stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Cutting Curly Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#haircare">Hair Care for Curly Hair</a></li></ul><h2 id="howto">How to Cut Curly Hair Yourself Brad Mondo</h2><p>Brad Mondo is a hairstylist with over 6 million subscribers on YouTube. He's known for his tutorials on cutting and coloring hair, and his tips are highly sought-after by those looking to save money on salon visits. Here's how to cut curly hair yourself using Brad Mondo's methods:</p><h3>1. Invest in Good Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have the right tools. You'll need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and hair clips to section off your hair. Don't use kitchen scissors or dull scissors - they'll only make the job harder. Invest in a good pair of hair cutting scissors, and make sure they're sharp.</p><h3>2. Start with Clean, Dry Hair</h3><p>It's important to start with clean, dry hair. Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, and let it air dry or use a diffuser on low heat. Don't brush or comb your hair after washing - this can cause breakage and damage. Instead, use your fingers to gently detangle your curls.</p><h3>3. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Use hair clips to section your hair into four equal parts - two on top and two on the bottom. This will make it easier to cut your hair evenly. Use a comb to create a straight part down the middle of your head, and then create a part from ear to ear. Clip each section out of the way.</p><h3>4. Start Cutting</h3><p>Take a small section of hair from the bottom, and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers, and use your scissors to cut off the ends. Cut a little at a time, and keep checking to make sure the hair is even. Repeat this process for each section of hair, working from the bottom to the top.</p><h3>5. Check for Evenness</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting your hair, check for evenness. Take a small section of hair from each section, and compare the lengths. If they're not even, trim the longer pieces until they match. Don't worry if your hair isn't perfect - curly hair is forgiving, and small imperfections won't be noticeable.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to cutting curly hair yourself:</p><ol><li>Invest in good tools, including a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and hair clips.</li><li>Start with clean, dry hair.

It's easier to cut more later than to try to fix a mistake.</li><li>Don't use a razor. Razors can cause frizz and damage to curly hair.</li><li>Don't cut your hair when it's wet. Curly hair shrinks when it dries, so it's important to cut it when it's dry.</li><li>Don't cut your hair too short. Curly hair tends to bounce up when it dries, so it's better to err on the side of caution.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting curly hair:</p><h3>Can I cut my own curly hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your own curly hair. Just make sure you have the right tools and follow the steps carefully.</p><h3>How often should I cut my curly hair?</h3><p>It's recommended that you cut your curly hair every 3-4 months to keep it healthy and prevent split ends.</p><h3>What if I make a mistake?</h3><p>Don't panic if you make a mistake! Curly hair is forgiving, and small mistakes can be fixed with a little bit of styling.</p><h2 id="haircare">Hair Care for Curly Hair</h2><p>Curly hair requires special care to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some tips for taking care of your curly hair:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner designed for curly hair.</li><li>Avoid brushing or combing your hair when it's dry.
