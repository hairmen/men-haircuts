Q: Can I safety pin any type of fabric?<br/> A: Yes, you can safety pin any type of fabric, but be careful not to damage delicate fabrics. <h2>Hair Care</h2> While safety pinning your low cut top, make sure your hair is out of the way to avoid any accidents. You can tie your hair up in a bun or ponytail, or use hair clips to keep it in place. Also, be careful not to accidentally prick your hair with the safety pin. </article>
