Our top pick is the <strong>Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Shampoo</strong>, which is specifically designed for curly hair.

Instead, use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair when it's wet.</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as this can weigh down your curls and make them look limp. Start with a small amount and add more as needed.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools, such as flat irons and curling irons, as these can damage your hair and cause breakage.
